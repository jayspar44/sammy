            Review this pull request and post a comment with your findings.

            REVIEW CRITERIA:
            - Security: exposed secrets, auth issues, input validation
            - Correctness: logic errors, edge cases, error handling
            - Performance: N+1 queries, memory leaks, inefficient code
            - Maintainability: readability, naming, DRY violations

            SEVERITY DEFINITIONS:
            - 🔴 BLOCKING: Must fix before merge (security, correctness, broken functionality)
            - 🟡 WARNING: Should fix (performance, error handling, maintainability)
            - 🟢 NIT: Optional minor improvements (style, naming, small refactors)
            - 🔵 FUTURE: Potential future enhancement (architectural improvements that don't impact current build but would benefit long-term)
